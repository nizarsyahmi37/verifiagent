## 🎯 Next Actions (Priority Order)

### 1. Twitter/X Posts (HIGHEST PRIORITY - Do Now!)

**Post the thread from TWEET_NOW.txt**

Location: `/Users/nizarsyahmi37/Desktop/ai/verifiagent/TWEET_NOW.txt`

**Timing:**
- Post 1: NOW (immediately)
- Repost: Tomorrow morning (8-10am EST)
- Tag: @colosseum_org, @solana in replies

**Why this matters:**
- Twitter drives human upvotes
- Colosseum likely monitors Twitter for visibility
- Gets project in front of judges
- Builds genuine interest

### 2. Engage with Twitter Mentions

**When people reply to your tweet:**
- Reply within 1 hour
- Thank them for trying the demo
- Answer technical questions with docs links
- Retweet if they share positive feedback

**Template replies:**
```
Thanks for checking it out! 🙏

[Specific response to their question]

Full docs: https://github.com/nizarsyahmi37/verifiagent
Let me know if you have other questions!
```

### 3. Forum Activity (When API Works)

The forum API is having issues, but keep trying:

**Posts to comment on:**
- #4508 - SlotScribe flight recorder (execution traces)
- #4539 - Black box problem (transparency)
- #4492 - Glass boxes (trust)
- #4485 - Agent decision loops (identity matters here)

**Comment template:**
```
[Acknowledge their post]
[Explain how VerifiAgent relates]
[Offer integration idea]
[Link to demo]
```

**Keep it genuine!** Don't spam. Add value.

### 4. Search for New Forum Posts

**Every 3-4 hours, check for new posts:**
```bash
curl -s "https://agents.colosseum.com/api/forum/posts?sort=new&limit=10"
```

**Look for:**
- "identity" mentions
- "trust" mentions
- "verification" mentions
- "Sybil" mentions
- Posts asking for teammates

**Engage authentically** - only comment if you have something valuable to add.

### 5. Monitor Project Page

**Check your project page:**
https://colosseum.com/agent-hackathon/projects/verifiagent-identity-execution-trace-protocol

**Watch for:**
- New upvotes (celebrate on Twitter!)
- Comments from judges (respond immediately)
- Questions in forum post

---

## 📊 What Works for Upvotes

### ✅ DO (Effective)
1. **Share technical achievements**
   - "Built complete Anchor program in one session"
   - "8 API endpoints, live demo, full docs"
   - Show the work

2. **Highlight the problem**
   - "$0 Sybil cost is killing agent adoption"
   - "No way to prove agent identity"
   - Real pain point

3. **Demo the solution**
   - "Try it live: verifiagent.up.railway.app"
   - "Full open source on GitHub"
   - Let people experience it

4. **Be authentic**
   - "Built this because agents need trust"
   - "Feedback welcome!"
   - Genuine communication

5. **Engage with community**
   - Upvote other projects
   - Comment thoughtfully
   - Build relationships

### ❌ DON'T (Banned/Ineffective)
1. **Ask for votes directly** - Violates policy
2. **Offer rewards** - Immediate disqualification
3. **Spam links** - Looks desperate
4. **Copy-paste comments** - Not genuine
5. **Manipulate vote counts** - Will get caught
