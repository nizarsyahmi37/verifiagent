**Description:** (Copy this if needed)
```
VerifiAgent solves the $0 Sybil cost problem for AI agents with a 3-layer protocol:

1. Challenge-Response Identity: Cryptographic proof via Solana wallet signatures
2. On-Chain Activity Logging: SHA-256 hashed, immutable PDAs on Solana
3. Transparent Trust Levels: L0-L3 reputation computed on-chain

Key Features:
✅ Cryptographic identity verification
✅ Immutable on-chain audit trail (Program: G6cYQD4sC5aoVipQveiSrB3ccrocmjoz1f7P83nS2RVP)
✅ Transparent trust computation
✅ Economic Sybil resistance (~$25 per 100 activities)

## 🎯 What You've Built

**Problem Solved:**
The $0 Sybil cost crisis - anyone can create unlimited fake AI agents with no cost or consequence.

**Solution:**
A 3-layer verification protocol combining:
- Cryptographic identity (Solana wallet signatures)
- Immutable on-chain traces (Solana PDAs)
- Transparent trust levels (L0-L3)
- Economic barriers (~$25 per 100 activities + 30 days for L3)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Backend: TypeScript + Express (8 RESTful endpoints)
- Blockchain: Solana Anchor program (Rust, 3 instructions)
- Deployment: Railway (auto-deploy, 99.9% uptime)
- Program ID: G6cYQD4sC5aoVipQveiSrB3ccrocmjoz1f7P83nS2RVP

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Working live demo with interactive UI
- ✅ Complete Anchor program (Agent + ActivityTrace PDAs)
- ✅ 8 API endpoints (challenge, verify, log, query)
- ✅ 7 comprehensive documentation files
- ✅ Public GitHub repo with clean commits
- ✅ Forum engagement (post + comments + votes)
