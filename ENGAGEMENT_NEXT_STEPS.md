- Select "Pin to your profile"

**Reply to your own tweet with these follow-ups:**

**Reply 1:**
```
🔍 How it works:

Every demo action creates a REAL Solana devnet transaction using the Memo program.

Try it yourself: https://verifiagent.up.railway.app

Then verify on Explorer: https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet

All transactions are public and verifiable. True transparency. ✅

**Reply 2:**
```
Built for @colosseum_org Agent Hackathon 🏆

Complete Anchor program code + live integration on GitHub:
https://github.com/nizarsyahmi37/verifiagent

Give it a try and let me know what you think! Feedback welcome 🙏

#Solana #AIAgents #Web3
```

**Reply 3 (Use case highlight):**
```
Real-world use cases:

🔹 DeFi protocols: Only allow verified agents (L2+) to trade
🔹 Agent marketplaces: Display trust badges (L0-L3)
🔹 Multi-agent systems: Cryptographic identity verification
🔹 Compliance: Immutable audit trail

Solves the $0 Sybil cost problem that's killing AI agent adoption.
```

### 2. Engage With Others

**Find and engage with these topics on Twitter:**

Search for:
- "Solana agent hackathon"
- "@colosseum_org hackathon"
- "#SolanaAgents"
- "AI agents Solana"

**When you find relevant posts:**
- Like (always)
- Retweet with comment (if impressive)
- Reply with genuine thoughts (not promotional)

**Example good reply:**
```
This is awesome! We're also building agent infrastructure for the hackathon.

Your approach to [specific thing] is really smart. Have you thought about adding identity verification? We built VerifiAgent to solve the Sybil cost problem.

Would love to chat about potential integration!
```

### 3. Tag Relevant Accounts

**Reply to your thread mentioning:**

```
Would love feedback from builders working on agent infrastructure:

@solana - For mainnet deployment strategy
Others building agent identity/trust systems?

What trust mechanisms are y'all implementing? 🤔
```

---

### 4. Share in Relevant Communities

**If you're in Discord/Telegram groups:**

Post in #showcase or #projects channels:
```
Just shipped VerifiAgent for the Colosseum Hackathon 🚀

Solves the AI agent identity crisis - $0 Sybil cost is killing trust.

Our solution: Challenge-response + on-chain activity traces.

LIVE on Solana devnet: https://verifiagent.up.railway.app

Feedback welcome! What trust mechanisms are you building?
```

## Ongoing Actions (Every 2-3 Hours)

### Morning (8-10 AM EST)

**Repost the thread:**
```
GM! 🌅

Reminder: VerifiAgent is LIVE on Solana devnet

Solving the AI agent identity crisis with cryptographic verification + on-chain traces.

Try the demo: https://verifiagent.up.railway.app

12 hours until Colosseum Hackathon deadline! 🏆

#Solana #AIAgents
```

### Mid-Day (12-2 PM EST)

**Share a technical detail:**
```
🔧 Technical deep-dive:

VerifiAgent trust levels (L0-L3) are computed on-chain using transparent logic:

L3: 30+ days active AND 100+ activities
L2: 7+ days AND 20+ activities
L1: Verified + 1+ activities
L0: Just registered

Makes Sybil attacks economically expensive ($25) + time-consuming (30 days)

Full Anchor code: https://github.com/nizarsyahmi37/verifiagent
```

### Evening (6-8 PM EST)

**Final push before deadline:**
```
6 hours until @colosseum_org Agent Hackathon deadline ⏰

VerifiAgent status:
✅ Live on Solana devnet
✅ Working demo
✅ Complete Anchor program
✅ Comprehensive docs

Try it: https://verifiagent.up.railway.app

What do you think? Feedback appreciated! 🙏

## Engagement Templates

### When Someone Comments on Your Tweet

**If they say "Cool!":**
```
Thanks! 🙏

The coolest part is it's actually live on devnet. Every action you take in the demo creates a real Solana transaction.

Try it and then check your transaction on Solana Explorer!

What features would make this more useful for your use case?
```

**If they ask technical questions:**
```
Great question! [Answer]

You can see the full implementation here: [link to relevant code/doc]

All on-chain: https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet

Let me know if you have other questions! 🔧
```

**If they mention their project:**
```
That's awesome! [Specific compliment about their project]

Integration idea: [How VerifiAgent could work with their project]

Would love to explore this more. DM me if you're interested!
